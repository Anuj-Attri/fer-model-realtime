# FER-Model's Real Time Predictions
Facial Expression Recognition Model deployment using FLASK.

## Deploying 

To deploy the model on your local host:
* Clone this rep on your device.
* Install dependencies from requirements.txt or extract the Conda Environment from Environment.
* Run main.py using `python main.py`
* Click on the generated domain link in the shell, or manually go to the ip address and port.

## About the model used
The pre-trained model is trained over multiple images using the dataset from Kaggle's FER-Challenge.
